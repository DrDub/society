Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the contributors managing and developing this open source project. In return, and in accordance with this project's [code of conduct](https://github.com/andrewtavis/Society/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), other contributors will reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements and new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. Note that all contributions to this project will be made under [the specified license](https://github.com/andrewtavis/Society/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request, otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the contributors might not want to merge into the project. With that being said, major additions are very appreciated!

When making a contribution, adhering to the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) process is the best way to get your work merged:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the repo, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd <repo-name>
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upsteam-owner>/<repo-name>
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout <dev-branch>
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks, and please try to adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Use Git's [interactive rebase](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-git-rebase) feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.

Thank you in advance for your contributions!
