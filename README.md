# Description [`↩`](#contents) <a id="description"></a>

**Society** is not in active development and is free to use or modify for anyone who has interest in it. The purpose was to create a version of Monopoly that is more descriptive of economic activity while adding elements of social interaction and team work. The file [resources/society_designs.sketch](https://github.com/andrewtavis/society/blob/main/resources/society_designs.sketch) is a full [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) file that has baseline designs for the board, cards, bills, and other game elements.

The Society board is split up based on cardinal directions. This allows events (see below) in the game to effect certain areas of the board. For physical resources (see below), the playing field is split so that materials and products are produced in the south, and energy and technology are produced in the north. For institutions (see below), there is a campus in the west and east corners that each have a university and a hospital, with the north and south of the board being districts that each have their own precinct and court at the respective corners.

Along the edge of the inner board are numbers that indicate the current turn. This allows players to choose a turn limit before play, that events should happen at a given turn, provide players with an action card (see below) at a given turn, etc.

# Rules

# Components

# Cards

### Events

Event cards are represented by the `?` symbol. The are played instantly, with players needing to then react to the description on the card.

### Actions

Action cards are represented by the `!` symbol. These cards are held in a player's hand and played throughout the game. Certain cards could necessarily be played during a player's turn, while others could be played at other times to disrupt the play of others.

# Resources

### Physical

The physical resources are materials, products, energy and technology. Each is needed to upgrade businesses or institutions based on what is produced and what level is being upgraded to. Physical resources could also be required in responses to event cards.

### Institutional

The institutional resources are knowledge, influence, health and force. Each of these is used in varying ways throughout play, with knowledge and influence being predominantly used to develop businesses or institutions, health being needed to stay alive or out of a hospital, and force being used to defend businesses, institutions, or player tokens.
