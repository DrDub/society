# Description [`↩`](#contents) <a id="description"></a>

**Society** is a version of Monopoly that is more descriptive of economic activity while adding elements of social interaction and team work. The game is not in active development and is free to use or modify for anyone who has interest in it. Discussions of how it could work could take place in the [Issues](https://github.com/andrewtavis/society/issues). [resources/society_designs.sketch](https://github.com/andrewtavis/society/blob/main/resources/society_designs.sketch) is a full [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) file that has baseline designs for the board, cards, bills, and other game elements. [resources/cards](https://github.com/andrewtavis/society/blob/main/resources/cards/) further has files that describe potential action and event cards.

The Society board is split up based on cardinal directions. This allows events in the game to effect certain areas of the board. For physical resources, the playing field is split so that materials and products are produced in the south, and energy and technology are produced in the north. For institutions, there is a campus in the west and east corners that each have a university and a hospital, with the north and south of the board being districts that each have their own precinct and court at the respective corners.

Along the edge of the inner board are numbers that indicate the current turn. This allows players to choose a turn limit before play, that events should happen at a given turn, provide players with an action card at a given turn, etc.

Components for Society would be a pair of dice, player tokens, bills, tokens that represent resources, cards that describe events in the game or actions that players can take, a market board that describes the current prices of certain resources, and cards that show ownership and upgrade steps for businesses and institutions.

# Play [`↩`](#contents) <a id="play"></a>

A fundamental decision at the start of Society was that everything can be owned privately or publicly. Think of this in terms of playing Monopoly, but one of the players could own the jail. The full details of how private and public ownership of businesses and institutions has yet to be decided on.

Play is similar to that of Monopoly where players role, go to the directed space, can buy it if it's unavailable, and if it's owned would then interact with the owner. Society adds resources to the game that function in a similar manner to those in Settlers of Catan. Rather than simply paying the owner and getting nothing in return as in Monopoly, Society gives a player the option to buy resources from the owner. Prices for the resources would be based on the current market price for a given resource, thus adding a macroeconomic element to the game. A player can always choose to deal with the market on their turn - potentially with a cost that would be determined by the market - but in dealing with the local economy the communal resources of all players increases, which thus allows for the society to be developed more easily.

As in Monopoly, businesses and institutions can be upgraded, which then allows them to produce more of their given resource as in Settlers of Catan. Also as in Settlers, upgrades are done via a specific combination of resources rather than with money.

Players can also choose the difficulty of the game at the start. This would entail not including some of the institutional resources (health, force, transfer costs, taxes, etc), which then would remove certain cards from the game.

There are many aspects of play that are yet to be figured out. Feel free to check the [Issues](https://github.com/andrewtavis/society/issues) or make one of your own to discuss them further.

# Winning [`↩`](#contents) <a id="winning"></a>

There are many ways to win in Society. The baseline condition to victory would be having the most resources at the end of the game, which would include the resources used to upgrade ones businesses and institutions. If playing with health, if all other players have died then the survivor would also be the winner. There is the potential to also add victory conditions such as goals that a player needs to achieve in order to win.

<br />

### Events

Event cards are represented by the `?` symbol. The are played instantly, with players needing to then react to the description on the card.

### Actions

Action cards are represented by the `!` symbol. These cards are held in a player's hand and played throughout the game. Certain cards could necessarily be played during a player's turn, while others could be played at other times to disrupt the play of others.

# Resources [`↩`](#contents) <a id="resources"></a>

<br />

### Physical

The physical resources are materials, products, energy and technology. Each is needed to upgrade businesses or institutions based on what is produced and what level is being upgraded to. Physical resources could also be required in responses to event cards.

### Institutional

The institutional resources are knowledge, influence, health and force. Each of these is used in varying ways throughout play, with knowledge and influence being predominantly used to develop businesses or institutions, health being needed to stay alive or out of a hospital, and force being used to defend businesses, institutions, or player tokens.

# The Market [`↩`](#contents) <a id="the-market"></a>

<br />

The most complicated part of Society is the market, which in turn adds one of the more interesting and educational elements to the game. The Market determines the prices for certain resources, with prices being effected by events in the game.
